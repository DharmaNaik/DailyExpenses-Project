# MySQL

Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

**developer will tell DevOps engineer that which Versions of the DB Software is used,as a DevOps engineer we have to install that version in DB server**

```
sudo su -
```

Step 1: Disable the default MySQL module from AppStream (important)
```
dnf module disable mysql -y
```

Step 2: Add the official MySQL 8.0 repository
```
dnf install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm -y
```

Step 3: Enable the MySQL 8.0 repo (it’s enabled by default but do this to be safe)
```
dnf config-manager --enable mysql80-community
```

Step 4: Install MySQL 8.0
```
dnf install mysql-community-server -y
```
Step 5: Start and enable MySQL
```
systemctl enable mysqld
```
```
systemctl start mysqld
```
Step 6: Optional – check installed version
```
mysql --version
```

see which mysql is running or not and on which port
```
netstat -lntp
```


***We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service.***

```
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass
```
`mysql_secure_installation` is a security script provided by MySQL that helps you:Set a root password (if not already set),Remove anonymous users,Disallow root login remotely,Remove the test database,Reload privilege tables.
`--set-root-pass` Setting the root password to Learning@123

***Verification***

Command to connect mysql server is

```
mysql -h mysql.flipkart.com -u root -p
```
enter Password `Learning@123`


Once you got mysql prompt, you can use below command to check schemas/databases.
```
show databases;
```

Once you are in particular schema, you can get the list of tables.
```
show tables;
```

You can get entries of a table using

```
select * from <table_name>;
```
