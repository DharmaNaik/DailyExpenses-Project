# MySQL

Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

**developer will tell DevOps engineer that which Versions of the DB Software is used,as a DevOps engineer we have to install that version in DB server**

***1.Before installing any version,we have to disable older version.***
```
sudo su -
```
```
sudo dnf remove mysql* -y
```
**dnf**   It is the package manager for RHEL-based Linux distributions,Used to install, update, remove, and manage software packages.

**-y**     Stands for "yes to all prompts"

***2.now install mySQL***
```
dnf enable mysql-server -y
```
```
dnf install mysql-server -y
```
see which mysql is running or not and on which port
```
netstat -lntp
```
***3.We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service.***

```
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass
```
`mysql_secure_installation` is a security script provided by MySQL that helps you:Set a root password (if not already set),Remove anonymous users,Disallow root login remotely,Remove the test database,Reload privilege tables.
`--set-root-pass` Setting the root password to Learning@123

## Verification

Command to connect mysql server is

```
mysql -h mysql.flipkart.com -u root -p
```
enter Password `Learning@123`

Once you got mysql prompt, you can use below command to check schemas/databases.
```
show databases;
```

Once you are in particular schema, you can get the list of tables.
```
show tables;
```

You can get entries of a table using

```
select * from <table_name>;
```
